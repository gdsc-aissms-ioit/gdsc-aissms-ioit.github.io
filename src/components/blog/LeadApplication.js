                      - Google Developer Groups are university based community
                      groups for students interested in Google developer
                      technologies.

                    <li>
                      - Students from all undergraduate or graduate programs
                      with an interest in growing as a developer are welcome.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      - By joining a GDG, students grow their knowledge in a
                      peer-to-peer learning environment and build solutions for
                      local businesses and their community.

                  <h3>What are the benefits of being a GDG Lead?</h3>
                  <p>
                    GDG Leads are the student leaders who are passionate towards
                    technology and want to change the world with technology.
                    Here are some of the benefits that I got from being a lead.
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li> - Network growth and instance exposure.</li>
                    <li>
                      - Community of people who are doing great in their fields.
                    </li>
                    <li> - Technical knowledge and project building.</li>
                    <li> - Confidence and personality building.</li>
                    <li> - Ability to take quicker and accurate decisions.</li>
                    <li>
                      - Cool schwags and goodies (that’s the last thing we
                      should look upto, but yes it adds in motivation!)
                    </li>
                  </ul>

                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      - Looking around in my college, I felt like we all
                      students are really keen to explore new things and learn,
                      but maybe aren’t aware of what’s around.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      - Google Developer technologies being widely used in the
                      market, I felt like Google Developer Student Club at our
                      college can really bring a revolution and help as many
                      people learn and explore their interests.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      - Also, I wanted to explore as much as I can in college -
                      try out public speaking, interacting with people, build my
                      network and join an amazing community of developers.
                    </li>

                      <li>
                        - Select country and the name of your GDG (if exists),
                        or add new chapter.
                      </li>
                      <li> - Share your social media profiles.</li>
                      <li>
                        - If you have been given a referral code, make sure to
                        mention it. (Referral code doesn’t guarantee your
                        selection and even the students without the code can get
                        selected.)

                      <li>
                        - Write about all the experiences you had being a part
                        of the community. Mention if you’ve been a member/core
                        team member of GDG. Describe your experience and
                        motivation to run a community.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        - Write about your leadership experience, what
                        challenges did you face and how you overcame them. This
                        part should describe you as a perfect leader. You can
                        also talk about your projects where you led the team.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        - The next part describes how technically strong you
                        are. You don’t need to be an expert. You should just
                        have an exposure and interest towards development. Any
                        basic project is fine.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <strong>
                          Tip - Even if you are working on the project, mention
                          it and resume working on it even after submitting the
                          application. You can showcase it later in your
                          interview. Also, if you have a project on dsa or any
                          simple project, try building an interface for it. One
                          page interface is fine too.
                        </strong>

                      become a lead.

                    <ul>
                      <li>Keep the video not longer than 1 and half minute.</li>
                      <li>
                        For the first half, rather than introducing yourself in
                        detail, mention only the brief points that describe your
                        leadership experience/skills and technical knowledge.
                      </li>

                      <li>
                        - Be happy and relaxed during the interview as the
                        interviewers are usually very friendly. Greet them when
                        they join the call.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        - Prepare your introduction properly as this can be the
                        first question asked.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        - Mention every detail that makes you eligible to become
                        the lead. Avoid adding unnecessary details.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        - Be prepared with your plan of running the club after
                        getting selected.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        - Be ready to speak about your technical projects. Start
                        with the best ones. Even if you are working on it,
                        mention your plan to complete it. Make sure to push the
                        code on github as you might be required to share it.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        - Keep all the links handy. (it can be your club
                        profiles, project repository and anything that you’ll be
                        mentioning in the interview.)
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        - Last few minutes can be informal talk, you can add to
                        the points the interviewer discusses with you, or
                        atleast make sure you are listening carefully to them.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Don’t interrupt the interviewer when they’re speaking to
                        you.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <strong>Imp</strong> - At the end, you’ll be asked if
                        you want to ask anything to the interviewer. Make sure
                        you are prepared before-hand with your questions. Never
                        reply with No.

                  <ol>
                    <li>
                      I was already a member of GDG AISSMS COE before we had one
                      in our college therefore I knew what GDG is.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      I was in touch with the lead of AISSMS COE - Ankita Ugale,
                      who guided me a lot during my application process. I also
                      got in touch with K.S. Wagh Sir during the application
                      process. He was very supportive and motivated all of us to
                      apply for the post and start a GDG at our campus.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      I prepared very well with my answers in my application. I
                      spent 2 days reviewing my answer and removing unnecessary
                      details. Around 7-8 folks from our class applied for the
                      position.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      As I was already working on 2 projects, I wrote about the
                      tech-stack I know and what I’ve done and planning to do
                      for my projects. Also, I mentioned my problem solving
                      skills.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      I noted down all the points I have to speak while
                      recording the video. I watched a few youtube videos by
                      ex-leads that gave me an idea. But, your video should
                      always be original. It took me 4 to 5 takes to shoot a
                      decent video. I wore a 30 Days of GCP T-shirt while
                      recording the video that displayed my experience with the
                      club. Check out my video here -{" "}

                    <li>
                      It took almost a month to hear back from them, and I was
                      very excited and nervous when I received an invitation for
                      the interview round. 2 of my friends were also selected
                      and they were equally eligible for the post and hence I
                      was a little nervous, but we 3 were excited to have a GDG
                      at our campus.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      I went through almost all the articles on the internet
                      where ex-leads had shared their experiences and tips for
                      the interview round.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Interview round was exactly the same as I have described
                      in the previous section. The interviewers were very
                      friendly and made sure I’m comfortable. A little
                      nervousness always kicks in which made me miss an
                      important point in the introduction. Also, I described my
                      hobby as writing and mentioned my writing profile. I
                      didn’t expect the interviewer to ask about my profile
                      link. I wasn’t ready with it and hence he asked me to mail
                      it to him after the interview. So along with the link, I
                      also mailed that important point that I had missed. I
                      wasn’t sure if I should do that or not but it’s at least
                      better than having regrets. Therefore keep all your
                      profiles and links handy.

                        So it was a rainy evening in the month of August. It was
                        raining heavily which caused a power cut. I was at home
                        and we were having a good family time, enjoying the rain
                        and talking about our old days.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        My phone rang and I went to my room to pick up the call
                        and the moment I was going to shut my phone off, I saw
                        an email notification from Advocu - GDG. Even before I
                        opened it, my heart had already started pumping.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        I read the first line and I was so damn excited that I
                        couldn’t even sit patiently to read the entire email. I
                        reread the first line and jumped out of excitement. So
                        much excitement that I didn’t even notice the tears of
                        joy flowing out of my eyes. I ran towards the living
                        room, shared the news and that was probably the best day
                        of my college life.

                        Although, I was also sad for 2 of my equally capable
                        friends who gave the interviews. But they were happy
                        too, at least we now had a GDG at our campus.

                      <li>
                        We had an amazing introductory session by GDG India
                        where I got to connect with all the leads around the
                        country.

                      <li>
                        Now the next step was to introduce GDG to the college
                        and identify a core team of passionate leaders. With
                        guidance of Wagh SirFaculty Advisor of our GDG) and
                        permission of Principal Sir, I had to organize an intro
                        event and this was the very first time I was going to
                        deliver/host an event to the public in the college. I
                        was nervous but excited. I didn’t expect a huge audience
                        of 250+ students who came up for the event. That was the
                        day when my public speaking skills got a boost and I
                        became more confident than ever. I was nervous but yes,
                        I had my friends supporting me throughout.

                        ML, Web, and a National Level Hackathon, I and my team
                        have had a super dooper amazing journey throughout! We
                        approached sponsors and luckily had the tech giant -
                        Tech Mahindra as our sponsor for the hackathon, which
                        had been our best event till date. Following which, we
                        recently organized a series of workshops on various
                        technologies.

                        The best part was building our own website, for which
                        the Web Team of GDG worked really hard! A competition
                        BloggerSpace was conducted on our own website which is a
                        matter of pride for us. Website not only brags about the
                        achievements of the club but also lets the community
                        share their experiences and inspire people, and I think
                        that’s the best part about our website.

                      Amazing core team to work with - I didnt even know these
                      folks before, but GDG has built the friendship and the
                      trust between us. For all of the tough decisions, we have
                      stood together as one team. Honesty and loyalty towards
                      the club is what makes you a perfect team member, and my
                      core team has proved that.
